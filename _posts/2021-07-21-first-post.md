- Finally, I have my own site. I do not have to write on Qiita and be afraid of anything is mistaken. But I will write them down carefully. Yes, blog! I enjoy writting it. And again:
- These are just notes I jot down while working on some specific projects. They should not be served as guidelines. However, if those do not affect your formal understanding of knowledge, welcome to read. If any misktakes are found, please contact me. Thank you!
- To be completely honest, I am very excited.
- よろしくお願い致します!

- [chiba1sonny.github.io](https://chiba1sonny.github.io/) is my github page. It is forked from [here](https://github.com/jpuritz/jpuritz.github.io). So if you guys want to create your own site and add some contents or make some changes to your site, go have a look at [here](https://github.com/jpuritz/jpuritz.github.io/blob/master/README.md). And thanks to [Beautiful Jekyll](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll/blob/master/README.md), which is a ready-to-use template for creating awesome website quickly. You can also refer to it and design your own website. 
- Below is some information you need to know to add contents and make changes to your site
- 1.Edit the `_config.yml` file to change some settings to reflect our site. It is readable.
- 2.To add pages, you can either write a markdown file `.md` (good choice) or you can write an HTML file directly.
- 3.I suggest stick with markdown if you don't know HTML.
- 4.Any file that you add inside the `_posts` directory will be treated as a blog entry. And this one will be the folder in which you add contents on a daily basis.
- 5.The notes we write will appear directly on the homepage. please refer to [this](https://github.com/MGLOrga/writing-template/blob/main/2000-01-01-template.md) for writing style.
