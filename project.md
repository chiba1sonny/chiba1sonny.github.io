## Research Project
- **Japan Urban Road Marking Segmentation**

<p align = "justify">
This project focuses on the problem of the existence of objects at multiple scales of the Road Marking Dataset, and investigate four kinds of network architectures that deal with the multiscale context. Inspired by previous studies, we propose a novel multi scale attention based dilated CNN to tackle the RMD. An attention module that can softly weight the feature maps from different scales and dilated convolution to enlarge the receptive field of feature maps to utilize a large range of spatial-context information are adopted. The two models that employ scales=⟨0.5,1.0⟩(Model 1) and scales=⟨1.0,2.0⟩(Model 2) are trained to evaluate five kinds of multiscale inputs on the RMD. At the inference time, Model 2, with scales={0.5,1.0,2.0}, gained the best mIoU of 74.88%. The ablation study shows that the proposed method yields the best results by combining multiscale attention and dilated convolution.
