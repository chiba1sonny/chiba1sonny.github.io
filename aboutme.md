### 😃 Hi, my name is Uudam(Junjie Wu). I have the following quality:

- I'm [INFJ](https://www.16personalities.com/infj-personality), also called advocater.


### 👀 Official me
<p align = "justify">
I was born in Inner Mongolia in 1994. My mother tongue is Mongolian and I was educated in Mongolian until college. I finished my bachelor degree at USTB, Beijing and am currently pursuing a Ph.D. degree at Chiba University. My main research lines are related to computer vision, machine learning, and intelligent transport systems, with a special focus on the application of computer vision techniques for road monitoring. My doctoral research is about road marking segmentation using attention mechanism-based CNN and mapping road marking quality at both lane level and city scale. In addition, I am also interested in disaster mitigation and have constructed three attenuation relationships of Peak Ground Velocity which can help estimate macroseismic intensity using machine learning techniques and improved the reliability of the empirical attenuation relationship under certain conditions in my master’s research.
